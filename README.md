# odyssey-translation-compendium
DSAM 3000 semester project, fall 2025: an odyssey translation compendium. 

# overview

this is the beginnings of the creation of a tool that would align the Greek text of "The Odyssey" alongside translations of the Greek. as of the Fall 2025 semester, the selected translations are that of Richmond Lattimore, and the newer translation offered by Emily Wilson. during this exploratory phase, focusing on the first point of inquiry below, the first stanza of Book 1 (approx. lines 1-10) will be worked with. for future tool-building, sections relevant to the second question below, involving monsters, would be aligned. 

# points of inquiry 

* during tool development: how does computation help or hinder the learning process when working with translations & variations across texts?
* following tool development: how do different translations of the odyssey portray and refer to monsters? 

# points of access

* GitHub Repository: displays the ReadMe markdown file documenting an overview of the project, and houses the relevant coding files for the project. in the spirit of this tool's development serving as a means of investigation in the learning process around translation work and the digital, test files will also be stored here to document trial (and, inevitably, a hell of a lot of error.)
* [Zotero Library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/6259732/odyssey_variorum): provides access to sources and points of inspiration for the project. 
* Notion Workspace (private): home to my personal Mindful Practice Journal, or what i've affectionately been calling my Captain's Log. also home to brainstorming documents, and other course materials related to DSAM 3000. 
* [Cargo Website](https://odyssey-variorum.cargo.site/edit/Y0061314437): displays a curated version of the aforementioned Captain's Log, as a means of documenting the learning process. will eventually house the compendium tool.
