# odyssey-variorum
DSAM 3000 semester project, fall 2025

basic concept: two translations of the odyssey compared with one another 

sources: lattimore, wilson, frankenstein variorum documentation, other DH project information, TEI XML documentation, greek text

computation involved: notebook files, github repo, zotero library, notion workspace, cargo site 

update as of early november: benchmarking across other digital humanities-related TRANSLATION projects, not just text variora after a super helpful discussion with Ben during office hours. it may not look like a lot is happening computationally, but i am working on the cargo site, and plan on really digging into markup stuff this week (11/9 - 11/15)
