      far journeys, after he had sacked Troy’s sacred citadel. </lb>
      Many were they whose cities he saw, whose minds he learned of</lb>
      many the pains he suffered in his spirit on the wide sea,</lb>
      struggling for his own life and the homecoming of his companions.</lb>
      Even so he could not save his companions, hard though</lb>
      he strove to; they were destroyed by their own wild recklessness, fools</lb>
      who devoured the oxen of Helios, the Sun God,</lb>
      and he took away the day of their homecoming. From some point</lb>
      here, goddess, daughter of Zeus, speak, and begin our story</lb> <p eID="book1_s1"\>
