       <line>far journeys, after he had sacked Troy’s sacred citadel.</line> 
       <line>Many were they whose cities he saw, whose minds he learned of,</line>
       <line>many the pains he suffered in his spirit on the wide sea,</line>
       <line>struggling for his own life and the homecoming of his companions.</line>
       <line>Even so he could not save his companions, hard though</line>
       <line>he strove to; they were destroyed by their own wild recklessness,</line>
       <line>fools, who devoured the oxen of Helios, the Sun God,</line>
       <line>and he took away the day of their homecoming. From some point</line>
